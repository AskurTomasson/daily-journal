                    with alot of freedom and responsibility was not something I could handle.
                    However now, learning how to code and studying again after being a store manager for... 
                    I dont even know how long, it's so much easier setting everything up, setting a goal and reaching it!
                    One thing I've learned is that life experience will teach you more then any school would,
                    You just gotta know how to read the signs that it's throwing at you and the path it's laying.

                    We started out 1 year ago but I've been rather shy, once we got into Javascript I fell deeply in love with your mysterious references.
                    Just as I feel I know you so well you throw a small fight that I hope google can solve and voila we're on our way again.`,

                    It was a simple function that took in a value (when scanning a barcode) and searched that value in a database,
                    if the value existed it would throw an alert saying that this value allready exist and needs to be processed.
                    Our IT says that I might be up for more projects in the company that I manage the store for, that would be great experience for me!`,

                    I started my HTML, CSS and JavaScript in freecodecamp like many others and I really do recommend that you check it out however 
                    I feelt like I had a hard time applying it to anywhere, I would really really really recommend Scrimba to anyone who wants to learn coding. 
                    It's the greatest studying tool that I've come upon and it makes sure you know what you're looking at.`,
